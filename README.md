SOCD (Snap Tap Emulation for FPS Games)

"SOCD" is a Windows application that virtually implements Razer's "Snap Tap" technology using the Windows API. "Snap Tap" is a feature in some Razer keyboards designed to optimize movement input for competitive first-person shooter (FPS) games, minimizing errors during complex directional inputs.

In many FPS games, simultaneous or conflicting key presses (like pressing both 'A' and 'D' at the same time) can result in unintended or imprecise movements, affecting gameplay performance. "Snap Tap" addresses this issue by intelligently recognizing and prioritizing the most effective input for smoother and more accurate movement.

This program replicates the "Snap Tap" technology at a software level, enhancing the gaming experience by ensuring that players maintain precise control over their in-game movement, reducing input lag, and avoiding conflicting keypress errors. It's especially beneficial for competitive players looking to gain a slight edge in movement precision.
